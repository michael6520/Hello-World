# Overview

This is the only hello world program I've ever had to debug. If it doesn't go without saying, it's a joke. It writes "Hello, World!" to the console except with only underscores in the main function. It's a certified monstrosity that never should have seen the light of day. It's borderline hostile, just looking at it stresses me out.

# Development Environment

I wrote it in C++ using Visual Studio. C++ seemed fitting for an unnecessarily overcomplicated hello world program, and I recently spent a lot of time working with it so it's fresh on my mind.
