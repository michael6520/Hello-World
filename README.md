# Overview

This is the only hello world program I've ever had to debug. If it doesn't go without saying, it's a joke. It writes "Hello, World!" to the console in the worst way I could get to work. All the variable, function, and class names are just a different number of underscores and debugging the even more complex versions was becommnig too much work for a joke. But the version I got working is still a certified monstrosity that never should have seen the light of day. It's borderline hostile, just looking at it stresses me out.

# Development Environment

I wrote it in C++ using Visual Studio. C++ seemed fitting for an unnecessarily overcomplicated hello world program, and I recently spent a lot of time working with it so it's fresh on my mind.
